  <h1>Description:</h1>

  <p>Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format, and a data visualization tool is the software that generates this presentation. 
    Data visualization provides users with intuitive means to interactively explore and analyze data, enabling them to effectively identify interesting patterns, infer correlations and causalities, and support sense-making activities. Data visualization can be categorized into two major sub-fields: information visualization and scientific visualization  Information visualization is used to visually represent abstract data, such as business data .while scientific visualization represents scientific data, which are usually physical Both information and scientific visualization focus on how to transform data into a visual form, to become understandable information for gaining insight and knowledge. the fundamental process of data visualization, in which data in any form can be transformed into graphical images. 
    When a user reads or looks at a graphical image, the image is interpreted through the human cognitive system for the acquisition of insight or the apprehension of useful information. information is data that has been given meaning by way of relational connection. This “meaning” can be useful but does not have to be. In computer parlance, a relational database makes for information from the data stored within it. Today businesses struggle to just store the massive amount of data whereas analyzing, interpreting and presenting it in meaningful ways is a thought for later . The main challenge of Big Data lies in capturing, storing, analyzing, sharing, searching, and visualizing data. One of the major aspect of Big Data analysis is that we can find interesting pattern in huge data set, but actually the result of the analysis is usually raw numbers and by those numbers it is very difficult to interpret anything. But if those numbers are represented visually then it becomes much easier for our brain to find meaningful patterns and take decision accordingly.  shows the benefits of Big data visualization .
Data visualization is certainly not a new thing; it has been around for centuries. Data visualization is easy and quick way to convey messages and represent complex things . We humans are adapted to find patterns in everything we see. Since the data is mounting at such a massive rate the traditional ways of presenting data is obsolete [1]. Compared to traditional data, Big Data is characterized by 5Vs, i.e. huge Volume, high Velocity, high Variety, low Veracity and high Value. Actual challenge is not only to process this huge amount of data but to process data with high diversity. High diversity and uncertainty in data reduces the response time of the application as it has to deal with not only traditional structured data but also with semi and unstructured data.
